        <h2>üîç What is an IP Address?</h2>
        <p>
          An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique identifier assigned to
          every device connected to the internet. It's like your device's digital
          address, allowing it to communicate with other devices and access online
          services.

        <h2>‚ùì FAQ</h2>
        <h4>What information does my IP address reveal?</h4>
        <p>
          Your IP address typically shows your general location (city/region) and
          internet service provider. It doesn't reveal personal information like
          your name or exact address.
        </p>

        <h4>Why do I need to know my IP address?</h4>
        <p>
          Knowing your IP address is useful for troubleshooting network issues,
          setting up remote access, configuring firewalls, or accessing
          region-restricted content.
        </p>

        <h4>Is my IP address permanent?</h4>
        <p>
          No, most IP addresses are dynamic and can change periodically. Your ISP
          may assign you a new IP address when you reconnect to the internet or
          after a certain period.
        </p>

        <h4>What's the difference between IPv4 and IPv6?</h4>
        <p>
          IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses (like 192.168.1.1) while IPv6 uses 128-bit
          addresses (like 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). IPv6 was
          created to provide more available addresses as IPv4 addresses are
          running out.
